CraigsList Scanner App Idea

Scan the Craigslist Free Stuff Index for your locale approximately once every 10 minutes.
Create a DB/cache of all of the postings (keep it limited to one month of age). 
Use some heuristics to generate a score for the item, as far as how likely you are to be interested in it.
Some heuristics include:
	- baseline interest level in item. e.g., I'll take practically any guitar or keyboard, I would take some desks/tables/chairs, and I would never take a fucking staircase (they were giving away a STAIRCASE on  CL, as in come to my house with contractors and remove the staircase from the house and take it with you... ?!?!)
	- amount of pictures and quality of pictures. If there are several pictures of a high-resolution, that's way better than one pic of 320x320 or something (or than no pic).
	- distance from my house! I'm not sure right off the bat how I'll get this programmatically
	- the amount of text present on the page. This shouldn't weigh in too much, but if there's a decent amount of text then it implies that the owner is serious about the listing. If theres like 4-5 words, there's a chane that they're noncommittal and that they might even forget they made a listing.
	- if there is a phone number

Presentations of this information:
	- Get a daily digest of all the popular items that are above a certain threshold. You should be able to scroll this digest similarly to how you would scroll on CL. However, make it look a bit prettier (not at the cost of smoothness though)
	- Get instant email alerts about specific items that really high scoring.
